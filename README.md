# itemized 
__Command-Line Interface__

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/itemized.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/itemized/)

This CLI is used to create an itemized list of all your node assets. I created `itemized` for use with React Native, as Metro Bundler requires assets to be imported statically.

## Installation

Run `npm install -g itemized` to install `itemized` globally.

## Commands

View the list of commands using `itemized --help`:
